function sum(a) {
var sum = a[0];
for(var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
sum += a[i];
}
return sum;
}

The above program to compute the sum of a list of numbers is incorrect. Why?
Correct the above program such that it works correctly.

The program doesn't work correctly because the sum includes the 0th element of the array twice.  To correct the program, simply change
var i = 0 to var i = 1.




function mystery(a) {
if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
else return a[0];
}

What does the above program do?

The program returns the greatest element of the array.  






Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element
to look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.
function binarySearch(list, element) {
if (list.length) = 1
}
